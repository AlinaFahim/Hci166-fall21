##Core Problem: Double Diamond Framework:

The main and the biggest problem of a hybrid classroom in under priviledged school is that they cant setup hybrid classroom because of less of facility available.Hybrid classroom needs some equipment like phone ,camera ,laptop ,pc or projector.And Internet Connectivity issue is also the main issue in under privi;ledged schools.The HCI (Human Computer Interaction) help teachers to learn new things and educate their students that how they will make hybrid environment for those students who cannot come to school due to illness or sickness.

##Final 10 Ideas Selected

###IDEA 1:DO VOLUNTEERING (original by [ALINA FAHIM IBRAHIM])
School should take  help from some organizations like TCF to arrange volunteering progams for students.

###IDEA 5:USE ASYNCHRONOUS LEARNING TO MAXIMIZE SYNCHRONOUS LEARNING . (original by [ALINA FAHIM IBRAHIM])
Time together in hybrid learning is precious, so students should be using asynchronous learning to absorb content and complete activities that will prepare them for a highly interactive synchronous class like a debate, presentation, or design sprint.Asynchronous learning means that bsorbing content,deep work and informative assignments. 
|PROS|CONS|
|-|-|
|Spending time in hybrid class will encourage students to learn new things and new technology|I think using asynchronous learning is not a bad idea.|

###IDEA 7:LEARN HOW TO HANDLE PROJECT AND SHARE YOUR SCCREEN. (original by [ALINA FAHIM IBRAHIM])
Teachers identified two core skills for using your device(s) well: learn how to handle  project of remote students on a screen in the classroom and learn how to share your screen with both remote and in-person learners. If you are fortunate enough to have multiple devices in your classroom, dedicate one to “broadcast” the class and the other for your own teaching purposes.
|PROS|CONS|

|Sharing screen will be a great option when if teacher teach students about screen sharing .|For new users, it create difficulty for new users to use screen sharing.|

###IDEA 8: MAKE TIME TO FOCUS ON REMOTE STUDENTS.(original by [FARIHA FAISAL])
Leaving some time at the end of class or just afterwards to focus entirely on the group of remote students can ensure their questions are answered and they feel cared for.

Create small groups can help in interaction.Periodic check-ins focused on getting to know your remote students, offering personalized support, and getting their feedback will help keep them engaged.
|PROS|CONS|
|-|-|
|Small groups are easy to access.|Guidelines are necessary for any online platform.|

---
###IDEA 10: TEACHER SHOULD REMIND THEMSELVES THAT LEARNING IS THE GOAL AND THIS WILL LOOK DIFFERENT FROM YEARS PAST.IT'S OKAY TO BE SLOW DOWN. (original by [FARIHA FAISAL])
