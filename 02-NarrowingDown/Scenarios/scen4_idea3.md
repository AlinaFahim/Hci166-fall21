IDEA 3 # CREATE SMALL GROUPS

  SCENARIO 4
 
Crossover groupsare also the way for creating groups .The class is sub-divided into two or more smaller groups with transfers of some students between groups at appropriate times. For example, students begin part A of a task in groups of four, after completing this, two people from one group swap places with two people from a second group â€“ to form a new group of four. The task then continues to part B.
