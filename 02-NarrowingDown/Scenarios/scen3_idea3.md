IDEA 3 # CREATE SMALL GROUPS

   SCENARIO 3
   
This construction process is greatly helped by the provision of frameworks, structures and mental models that help learners to begin to organise and arrange knowledge in ways that are meaningful to them. This means that each learner will build their understanding in an individualistic way and will find different personal connections points of relevance in their learning.

As a small group teacher it is going to be important to:

challenge students to think for themselves
help students to organise and structure their thoughts and ideas,
encourage students to vocalise and discuss their views and understandings
design learning activities and tasks that require students to actively engage
give students feedback on what they are doing well and how they can improve.
